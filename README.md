For deployment:

1. Just do/create a project on google cloud - cloud.google.com.
2. Then create API key in Google ai studio importing the project you build in step 1.
3. Just take that API key and paste in code.
4. Then just run the project once and cross check the ai working in the project.
5. Lastly deploy it anywhere you wish. 😉 🫶
